            The young boy just turned sixteen <br>
            And I got six fours and hot bikes that I rock <br>
            Keep three or four sweeties on my clock, <br>
            But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him <br>
            Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop, <br>
            'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk <br>
            That sassy tempo with that walk, <br>
            Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me <br>
            <p></p>
